		 	<h2>Services</h2>
				<p>I’ve tackled many projects in multiple areas of the design, communications and tech industries using a variety of disciplines. Collecting many skills throughout these ventures I have learned to combine my tools and strategies to create and deliver functional and aesthetically pleasing online experiences.</p>

			<h2>Web Design & Development</h2>
			<p>From concept to launch I always emphasize a user-centered approach. Beginning with a distinctive holistic mindset I approach projects looking at the big picture; your goals and the problem that will be solved. Starting from the beginning I connect the dots in creating clean and functional web experiences. I thrive on brainstorming and collaborating with creative minds and ideas until I reach one that will ensure your relevant and pragmatic online presence. No matter what your taste and style, your online statement will reflect your brand. How do you want to interact with your viewers? My favourite answer? Every. Single. Way. - which is why I create websites responsively for all screen sizes. If you need a single page portfolio/product piece, an e-commerce experience, a content management system (Wordpress, Siteleaf, etc.) or to engage your audience with integrated audio or video content - I want to be the human to help you make your online presence strong and impactful.  </p>

			<h2>Photography</h2>
			<p>When it comes to photography and your online appearance (website, social media, etc.) stock photography or over pixelated photos can make your website look stiff and unprofessional. Do you have products that you need to be styled and captured? Need a headshot beautifully and professionally lit? Have an event you need moments captured at? I work with an incredible photographer who’s been working in Toronto for 5+ years - never failing to deliver pristine quality shots. </p>
